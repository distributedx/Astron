Astron
--------------
_A Server Technology for Realtime Object Networking_

> This is a fork of the original [Astron][astron] project. 

Astron is an open-source, distributed server suite particularly well-suited for powering MMO games.
The design is inspired by a similar unrelated project developed at the Disney Interactive Media
Group, and used in-house from 2001 until 2013.

The suite consists of many components, which handle separate tasks in order to distribute
the workload of managing a multi-sharded game/application environment with many objects and clients.
